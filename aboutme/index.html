 <h2>Lehiga Koudou</h2> 
 <p>Hello! I'm Lehiga, I'm form Cote D'Ivoire, which is a french speaking country in west Africa. We share boader with Ghana.
    I served a full time mission in Ghana Kumasi Mission, I'm single (YAS). I was baptised in the church of Jesus Christ of later 
    day saints on the 3rd May 2015. It's been ever since a wonderful life for me. I'm so lucky to be part of this big family of
    the saints. My favourite quote is "Jesus Christ ....doesn't see our lack as failure but rathernas an opportunity to exercise 
    faith and grow" by Michelle D. Craig.

    <p> I'm working toward a degree in Apply technology BS. One thing I like about BYU is its online lower course program and
        the opportunity to learn things of the world and link it to the gospel principes which give room to the holy Ghost to
        teach us the truth. I'm currently working as a Personel Assistant at the WSRS in Abidjan. I'm so excited to learn amazing 
        things from this course.
